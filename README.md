# tic_tac_toe_game_using_python_CLI_interface
 Building s simple Tic Tac Toe using the fundamental concepts of python. This is one of the basic mini project which I had created while I used to practice my language proficiency and project building skills.
 Hello world! Mayank Singh this side, this project I had divided it into 13 Main steps and at last Gameplay step.
 I will be mentioning the steps as comment in the code file (main.py) itself and also will be commenting as much as possible to make the code more readable and easy to understand.
 Thank You!
